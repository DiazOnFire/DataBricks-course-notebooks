    "* The \"translation\" task for `pipeline` takes optional parameters `src_lang` (source language) and `tgt_lang` (target language), which are important when the model can handle multiple languages.  To figure out what codes to use to specify languages (and scripts for those languages), it can be helpful to find existing examples of using your model; for NLLB, check out [this Python script with codes](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Geonmo/nllb-translation-demo/blob/main/flores200_codes.py) or similar demo resources.\n"

    "### Open-ended exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cells below, we provide code for running the tokenizer and model on the articles.  Your task is to play around with the various configurations to gain more intuition about the effects.  Look for changes to output quality and running time in particular, and remember that running the same code twice may result in different answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we list brief descriptions of each of the parameters you may wish to tweak.\n",
    "* Tokenizer encoding\n",
    "  * `max_length`: This caps the maximum input length.  It must be at or below the model's input length limit.\n",
    "  * `return_tensors`: Do not change this one.  This tells Hugging Face to return tensors in PyTorch (\"pt\") format.\n",
    "* Model\n",
    "  * `do_sample`: True or False.  This tells the model whether or not to use sampling in generation.  If False, then it will do greedy search or beam search.  If True, then it will do random sampling which can optionally use the top-p and/or top-k sampling techniques.  See the blog post linked below for more details on sampling techniques.\n",
    "  * `num_beams`: (for beam search) This specifies the number of beams to use in beam search across possible sequences.  Increasing the number can help the model to find better sequences, at the cost of more computation.\n",
    "  * `min_length`, `max_length`: Generative models can be instructed to generate new text between these token lengths.\n",
    "  * `top_k`: (for sampling) This controls the use of top-K sampling, which forces sampling to ignore low-probability tokens by limiting to the K most probable next tokens.  Set to 0 to disable top-K sampling.\n",
    "  * `top_p`: (for sampling) This controls the use of top-p sampling, which forces sampling to ignore low-probability tokens by limiting to the top tokens making up probability mass p.  Set to 0 to disable top-p sampling.\n",
    "  * `temperature`: (for sampling) This controls the \"temperature\" of the softmax.  Lower values bias further towards high-probability next tokens.  Setting to 0 makes sampling equivalent to greedy search.\n",
    "* Tokenizer decoding\n",
    "  * `skip_special_tokens`: True or False.  This allows you to skip special tokens (like EOS tokens) in the model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not tweak:\n",
    "* Tokenizer encoding\n",
    "  * `padding`: True or False.  This helps to handle variable-length inputs by adding padding to short inputs.  Since it should be set according to your task and data, you should not change it for this exercise (unless you want to see what warnings or error may appear).\n",
    "  * `truncation`: True or False.  This helps to handle variable-length inputs by truncating very long inputs.  Since it should be set according to your task and data, you should not change it for this exercise (unless you want to see what warnings or error may appear).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need more info about the parameters of methods, see the `help()` calls in cells below, or search the Hugging Face docs.  Some top links are:\n",
    "* Tokenizer call for encoding: [PreTrainedTokenizerBase.\\_\\_call\\_\\_ API docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.28.1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__)\n",
    "* Model invocation: [Docs for generation strategies](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/generation_strategies) and this blog post on [\"How to generate text: using different decoding methods for language generation with Transformers\"](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate)\n",
